# Sp-2024-Portfolio-Website
Portfolio website for spring 2024 project
You will be creating a portfolio website, how the website looks is entirely up to the group to discuss.

I reccomend you create it as a Template, so other members can use it as their portfolio website.

here are some challenges you can attempt (as a group or individuallly reminder that these do not have to be implemented, they are optional if you are looking for a challenge! )

1. Try using a front-end framework (react, angular, vue) instead of vanilla js html css
2. Get Github student developer pack and deploy your website using azure (youll have to read about azure and cloud services) https://education.github.com/pack
3. Use a weather API to display current weather information
